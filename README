CodeShield_Scratch_Extension
============================

We are sorry to say that the CodeShield_Scratch_Extension is no longer supported by Scratch 2.0. Scratch communication via JSON string has been removed from Scratch 2.0 and has been replaced with HTTP.
See https://github.com/MrYsLab/S2A for an HTTP interface that is supported by Scratch 2.0

S2A was written in Python as opposed to Java used in the CodeShield_Scratch_Extension.

This repository is being left in place for historical purposes only.

This repository contains source and runtime files.

Refer to CodeShield_HWE_Reference.pdf for further details.
